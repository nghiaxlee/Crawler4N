## Background:
After the end of every semester, my university (ELTE) asks us to fill surveys for all of the courses we have on that semester (usually I have 10-12 courses). I know that I should fill it to support the university (hope so), though, with the power of laziness and the will to learn Python and Selenium, this tool was born...

- Selenium (through pip, conda, etc...)
- Geckodriver:
  - For Mac: brew install geckodriver
  - For Windows: ...
- Add folder contains Geckodriver to system enviroment path.

## Instruction:

- Prepare username and password in a text file (unwise, yep :()
- Run AutoFillForm.py and follow the instruction

## TODO:
