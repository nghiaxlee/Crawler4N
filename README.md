## Story:
After the end of every semester, my university(ELTE) asks us to complete surveys for all of the courses we have on that semester (usually I have 10-12 courses). I know that I should fill it to support the university (hope so), though, with the power of laziness and the will to learn Python and Selenium, this tool was born...

## Requirements:
- Download Selenium and add folder contains geckodriver to system enviromentpath.

## Instruction:
- Update ou.ou using the Neptun's HTML source code (https://hallgato.neptun.elte.hu/main.aspx?ctrl=h_opinion&issub=true)
- Prepare username and password in a text file (really unwise, trying to find other method)
- Run AutoFillForm.py and follow the instruction
